# NavigationDrawer_Template
Navigation Drawer iOS 13 - native Swift; no additional frameworks etc. required

Because I couldn't find a proper NavigationDrawer for iOS 13, I made a native swift NavigationDrawer template. If you have a nice idea, how to create the Navigation-Drawer-Items dynamically, I would love to hear about it.

!!! The global color-variables are for the purpose of showing, where to set the colors for that thing - please don't blame me on that, it's for your good. !!!

Anyway: Enjoy that thing and I would like to hear, if you actually use it and if you have a better idea of how to do anything in there.
